# SootDiff - Bytecode Comparison Across Different Java Compilers

This repository hosts the SootDiff analysis tool. SootDiff allows the comparison of the Java ByteCode create by different Java compilers.
To do so it uses static analysis and optimizations to unify the generated ByteCode, e.g. Constant Propagation, Dead Code Elimination, String Handling. Its goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a tool and library on which they can base their own research projects and product implementations. 

## Obtaining SootDiff
You can either build SootDiff on your own using Maven, or you can download a release from here on Github.

### Downloading the Release
The Release Page contains all pre-built JAR files for each release that we officially publish. We recommend using the latest and greatest version unless you have a specific issue that prevents you from doing so. In that case, please let us know.


### Building SootDiff with Maven
To build SootDiff with Maven run
```
mvn install
```

or to build a standalone `jar-with-dependencies` run
```
mvn clean compile assembly:single
```
