# SootDiff - Bytecode Comparison Across Different Java Compilers

This repository hosts the SootDiff analysis tool. SootDiff statically computes data flows in Android apps and Java programs. Its goal is to provide researchers and practitioners with a tool and library on which they can base their own research projects and product implementations. We are happy to see that FlowDroid is now widely used in academia as well as industry.

## Obtaining SootDiff
You can either build SootDiff on your own using Maven, or you can download a release from here on Github.

### Downloading the Release
The Release Page contains all pre-built JAR files for each release that we officially publish. We recommend using the latest and greatest version unless you have a specific issue that prevents you from doing so. In that case, please let us know (see contact below).
